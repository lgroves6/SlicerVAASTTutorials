# SlicerVAASTTutorials.github.io
This repository contains tutorials for using Slicer infastructure developed by the VASST lab (Western University). Please refer to http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/ and computerassistedsurgery.robarts.ca for information on connecting to the PlusServer and streaming imaging and tracking information into Slicer. The tutorial's presented in this repo are dependent on the user creating appropriate configuration files and properly connecting to the PlusServer.

The tutorials include: 

1. Co-registration between HTC VIVE and spatial tracking - This calibration allows for tracked tools to be visualized within the HTC VIVE head-mounted display. 

2. Guided Ultrasound Calibration (GUSCAL) - This calibration allows for the ultrasound image to be registered to the tracker's coordinate system such that it can be visualized in its native location.
